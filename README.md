# checkyourartistWeb
Artist checker WebApp (working title)


Please add your on branch to the repositiory and keep working on that branch. If we decide to make an app later on, there will be an extra repo called checkyourartistApp, but thats probably too early. 
Create your own feature-branch with the name work/<yourname> and do whatever you want on it.
If you've got anything to publish to the actual Project please send a pullrequest to dev, as soon as at least one of us approved the changes, the pullrequest will be merged into dev. 

I suggest one push to master per month or week, depending on how fast and efficient changes are made.
